    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Everyone needs a tried-and-true recipe for simple baked 
         chicken in their back pocket. On the hunt for the perfect 
         one? We've got you covered with this top-rated recipe for
         baked chicken breasts. It's versatile, universally crowd-pleasing, 
         and (best of all) incredibly easy.</p>
      <p><strong>How long to cook the chicken?</strong>It depends on the 
        size of the chicken breasts. Smaller chicken breasts will bake in
        a shorter amount of time, while larger breasts will take a bit 
        longer. If you use the 5-ounce breasts the recipe calls for, the 
        chicken should be ready after about 25 minutes in the pre-heated oven.
        When the chicken is done, the juices will run clear and an instant
        read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
        at least 165 degrees F.</p>
    <br>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or more to 
            taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
     <h2>Directions</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides 
        with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer
             pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes 
             more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
             read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off
             the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to 
             dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
