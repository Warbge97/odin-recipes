    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you're looking for an easy weeknight dinner that comes together quickly, we've got you 
        covered with this top-rated tilapia recipe. This pan-seared tilapia couldn't be simpler to 
        make in just 15 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>What is Tilapia?</strong> Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky 
        texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular types of fish in the United States because
        it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.</p>
    <p><strong>Tilapia Seasoning:</strong>There are plenty of delicious ways to season tilapia, but we're 
        partial to the flavors found in this recipe: salt, pepper, lemon juice, flat-leaf parsley, and fresh 
        thyme. If you want to spice things up a bit, try adding garlic and/or cayenne pepper.</p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillet</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
     </ul>
    <br> 
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both 
            sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Brush the melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
        <br>
